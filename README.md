**Objective:**

 -This study aims to classify an employee in order to identify the likelihood of this employee leaving the company.
 
 -This study was generated to complement my machine learning study, using the dataset provided at: https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset


**Techniques:**

 -Techniques for data normalization were used on this dataset, and three machine learning techniques for classification were implemented: Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.


**Conclusion:**

 -After normalization, I identified that for this dataset, the Logistic Regression algorithm had the highest accuracy rate, so I decided that it would be the perfect algorithm for the model.
